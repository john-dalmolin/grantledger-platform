## Workspace Source Of Truth

This repository is maintained from:

- `/Users/johndalmolin/Downloads/projetos/backend/nodejs/grantledger-platform`

Archived copies are kept outside this folder and are not part of the active
development flow.

## Git Workflow

- Strategy: feature branches from `main`
- Merge policy: squash merge
- Branch examples:
  - `feat/gl-002-auth-tenant-context`
  - `fix/<issue>-<slug>`
  - `chore/<issue>-<slug>`

Operational rules:

- One issue per branch and one PR per branch.
- No direct commits to `main`.
- Board tracking is issue-first.
