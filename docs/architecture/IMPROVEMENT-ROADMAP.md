## Target Architecture Principles

- Domain contains pure business invariants and state transitions.
- Application contains use-case orchestration, ports, idempotency flow, and audit coordination.
- API/infra contains request parsing, dependency wiring, transport mapping, and adapters.
- External SDKs remain isolated at infrastructure edges.
- Canonical contracts/events are explicit and versioned.

## Current Prioritized Sequence

1. ARCH-020: full operational observability baseline (in progress)
2. ARCH-022: performance, resilience, and readiness finalization (planned)

- Preserve ARCH-018/ARCH-021/ARCH-019 baselines while hardening observability in ARCH-020 before final readiness in ARCH-022.

## Delivery Strategy

- One architecture issue per PR.
- Keep architecture PRs focused and reviewable.
- No unrelated business scope mixed into ARCH PRs.
- Required gates per PR:
  - `npm run quality:gate`
  - `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://grantledger:grantledger@localhost:5432/grantledger npm run test:pg` (CI mandatory)
  - Security baseline checks (`Dependency Audit`, `CodeQL`)

## Mandatory Governance Workflow (Always)

### Start of issue

- Mark issue as `IN_PROGRESS` in `ARCH-TRACKER.md`.
- Register issue link, branch name, and planned scope.
- Update roadmap focus/dependencies.
- Create ADR draft when new architectural decision is needed.

### End of issue (before merge)

- Mark issue as `DONE` in `ARCH-TRACKER.md`.
- Register PR link and merged SHA.
- Update roadmap next step and residual risks.
- Finalize ADR changes or explicitly register `No ADR change required`.

## Success Criteria for ARCH Stream

- No core business logic concentrated in monolithic modules.
- Layer boundaries are clear and reviewable.
- Validation, time policy, and error mapping are standardized.
- Idempotency orchestration is generic and reusable.
- Governance docs stay synchronized with code and PR lifecycle.

## Next execution focus: ARCH-020

- Establish full operational observability baseline (logs, metrics, tracing, and core dashboards).
- Define alerting and runbook expectations for critical failure modes.
- Keep compatibility with ARCH-019 error metadata so telemetry can use stable error keys.
