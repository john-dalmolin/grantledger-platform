# GrantLedger Architecture Improvement Roadmap

## Context

This roadmap tracks architecture hardening as a continuous stream running in parallel with feature delivery.

Canonical references:

- Tracker: `docs/architecture/ARCH-TRACKER.md`
- Guardrails: `docs/architecture/ARCH-GUARDRAILS.md`
- Boundary decision: `docs/adr/ADR-005-domain-vs-application-boundary.md`

## Progress Snapshot

- ARCH-001 completed (`#31`)
- ARCH-002 completed (`#32`)
- ARCH-003 completed (`#34`, merge `dc7404d`)
- ARCH-004 completed (`#37`, merge `46e6804`)
- ARCH-005 completed (`#40`, merge `b72ef69`)
- ARCH-006 in progress (`#42`, branch `chore/arch-006-generic-idempotency-executor`)

## Target Architecture Principles

- Domain contains pure business invariants and state transitions.
- Application contains use-case orchestration, ports, idempotency flow, and audit coordination.
- API/infra contains request parsing, dependency wiring, transport mapping, and adapters.
- External SDKs remain isolated at infrastructure edges.
- Canonical contracts/events are explicit and versioned.

## Current Prioritized Sequence

1. ARCH-006: Generic idempotency executor (in progress)
2. ARCH-007: i18n foundation (`en_US`)

## Next execution focus: ARCH-006

- Introduce generic async idempotency executor in application layer.
- Migrate subscription custom idempotency flow to shared foundation.
- Align auth flow with shared executor.
- Adopt key-based dedup orchestration in payment webhook flow.

## Delivery Strategy

- One architecture issue per PR.
- Keep architecture PRs focused and reviewable.
- No unrelated business scope mixed into ARCH PRs.
- Required gates per PR:
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run test`
